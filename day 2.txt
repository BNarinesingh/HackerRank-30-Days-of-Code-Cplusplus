/*Given: 
Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost.
We round  to the nearest dollar (integer) and then print our result:
The total meal cost is 15 dollars.
